# State file format

A state file allows you to write out the state of the system registers in a way that allows you to test a known good implementation against your emulator to enable fast debugging.

## Format

The format is:

```
{AF:X}{BC:X}{DE:X}{HL:X}{SP:X}{PC:X}\n
```

Where all registers are written out as 16bit hex strings. That makes every step exactly 12 characters long. A newline is added for legibility.
